The Stressnet So Far

First thing's first: While we are nearing the end of the 2 month window originally planned, the stress testing is planned to continue for at least another 2 months. (insert plan details here). For anyone willing, your continued or new participation is welcome!

# Fun stats and graphics (insert here)
Largest block was 7.96 MB at height 2535337 with 4652 transactions.
Most transactions in a block is 4909 at height 2535307
Most transactions cleared in 30 blocks: 100863 transactions starting at block 2547555.

#Results:

cryptonote_core: only verify txpool when the hardfork value has changed.
https://github.com/monero-project/monero/pull/9404

Blockchain: fix temp fails causing alt blocks to be permanently invalid
https://github.com/monero-project/monero/pull/9395

tx_pool: update internal data structure to boost::bimap.
https://github.com/monero-project/monero/pull/9376

Daemons processing big blocks may bump against serializer sanity checks and fail to sync

# My Personal Opinions

#Items for future attention:
examine inability of rpc wallet to connect to daemon during large mempool
why mempool sometimes prunes itself below the max weight?


#potential tests
take private testnet to 30MB block by manipulating mining/broadcast. Just the exercise of sync'ing it will be useful.
block propagation speed testing
practical performance eval for hardware / connection speeds
