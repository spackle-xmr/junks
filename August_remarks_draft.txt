The Stressnet So Far

Testing has been successful, and plans have already been made to continue the network for at least another 2 months. While we have reached the end of the originally planned time frame, there is an enduring need for further testing. For anyone willing, your sustained or new participation is welcome! 

The stressnet is resetting on August 10 by reforking the testnet. All node operators should run the latest (release)[https://github.com/spackle-xmr/monero/releases/tag/v251.18.3.3.0] to participate. Ongoing discussion is being held on Matrix at #monero-stressnet:monero.social and Libera Chat IRC on ##monero-stressnet.


#Results:

As a result of testing, developers have produced a set of upgrades. They cover correctly recognizing blocks as valid during abnormal operation, increasing daemon performance during large transaction volumes, and discussing synchronization design.

Blockchain: fix temp fails causing alt blocks to be permanently invalid
https://github.com/monero-project/monero/pull/9395

Daemons processing big blocks may bump against serializer sanity checks and fail to sync
https://github.com/monero-project/monero/issues/9388

tx_pool: update internal data structure to boost::bimap.
https://github.com/monero-project/monero/pull/9376

cryptonote_core: only verify txpool when the hardfork value has changed.
https://github.com/monero-project/monero/pull/9404


#Stats and graphics
Largest block was 7.96 MB at height 2535337 with 4652 transactions.
Most transactions in a block is 4909 at height 2535307
Most transactions cleared in 30 blocks: 100863 transactions starting at block 2547555.
See the full stressnet block size data (here)[https://github.com/spackle-xmr/chaindata_graphics/blob/main/stressnet/2_month_block_sizes.png]

I created some animations to help display stressnet data:
(Chronological Animation)[https://github.com/spackle-xmr/chaindata_graphics/blob/main/stressnet/chronological_animation.gif] showing the block size (blue) and penalty median (red) over the testing period
(Month 1 Combined Plots)[https://github.com/spackle-xmr/chaindata_graphics/blob/main/stressnet/stressnet_animation_month1.gif] showing the block size, penalty median, miner reward, and penalty for the first month
(Month 2 Combined Plots)[https://github.com/spackle-xmr/chaindata_graphics/blob/main/stressnet/stressnet_animation_month2.gif] showing the block size, penalty median, miner reward, and penalty for the second month
(Sorted Chronological Animation)[https://github.com/spackle-xmr/chaindata_graphics/blob/main/stressnet/sorted_chronological_animation.gif] showing the block size (blue) and penalty median (red) over the testing period, with the blocks for each frame sorted by size. If the description seems confusing just watch this at the same time as the chronological animation; you'll see what I was going for.


#Items for future attention:
Resolve inability of rpc wallet to connect to daemon during large mempool
Examine why mempool sometimes prunes itself below the max weight
Large block propagation/verification speed benchmarking.
Practical performance eval for hardware / connection speeds
