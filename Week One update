Stressnet: First Week Summary

The first week has been a wild ride, and there is a lot to share. Presented roughly by order of importance:

#PR for wallet startup speed up
Restarting a node while there is a large mempool takes a long time, as the node must process all the mempool transactions before resuming regular operation. 0XFFFC0000 has addressed this with a massive speed up in [PR 9376](https://github.com/monero-project/monero/pull/9376). These changes are in use now on the stressnet to great effect.

#Block Sync Size
Block propagation suffers at larger block sizes, and encourages the creation of alternate chains. Setting â€“block-sync-size 1 allows nodes to process larger blocks more easily, and this is now standard practice on the stressnet. Further updates are expected on this soon.

#Ongoing Investigations
Block sync size
flush_txpool processing time
Wallet-to-daemon connectivity and performance enhancements

#General Announcements
Go to monitor.stressnet.net to see network stats
explorer.stressnet.net is offline for now. 
Node operators should upgrade to latest [release](https://github.com/spackle-xmr/monero/releases/tag/v250.18.3.3.2) for a smooth stressnet experience. Older releases struggle with larger blocks, and ban too many nodes.
Congratulations to strawberry, winner of the wallet draining competition
