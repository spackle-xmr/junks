##Monero Stressnet: Run A Node and Improve Monero

Before Monero gets to FCMP++ it might move to larger rings, but this requires some daemon improvements. To quote selsta: "a large increase to the ring size is going to risk the stability of the network if we don't fix the known daemon inefficiency bugs first."

A testnet fork (the stressnet) has been created to stress test the daemon and diagnose performance bottlenecks. To participate, you can simply run a node using this release (launch monerod with --testnet): https://github.com/spackle-xmr/monero/releases/tag/v250.18.3.3.1

Testing begins on June 19th at 15:00 UTC. Current bugs require a significant number of connections to observe, so we need as many nodes on the stressnet as possible. Improving monerod is a worthwhile endeavor that deserves to be done, whether it enables a fork to larger rings or not.

Ongoing discussion is being held at #monero-stressnet:monero.social (IRC is ##monero-stressnet)
